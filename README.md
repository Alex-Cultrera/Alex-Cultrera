### Hi there 👋, I'm Alex Cultrera


🛠️ I work with Java, Spring, MySQL, AWS, Hibernate, React, JavaScript, Thymeleaf, HTML, and CSS. 

🔭 I focus on building scalable, performance-optimized web applications. I am experienced in building MVC-based views, including React for dynamic, client-side interfaces as well as Thymeleaf for server-side rendering, and I implement Hibernate mapping for seamless back-end integration. I am passionate about continuous learning and applying new technologies to solve complex challenges, and have a growing interest in React and AWS. Additionally, I bring over a decade of experience in project management, operations, sales, and digital marketing, which gives me a unique, well-rounded perspective on both technical and business challenges.
 
🤝 Let's connect and explore how I may be able to optimize workflows and tackle complex challenges for you and your organization.
