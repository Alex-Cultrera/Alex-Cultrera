### Hi there 👋, I'm Alex Cultrera


🛠️ I work with Java, Spring, MySQL, React, JS, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently immersed in a rigorous, Java focused, software development bootcamp with @CodersCampus, where I'm honing my technical abilities and gaining practical experience as a full stack developer. 

🔭 I am looking to blend my technical skillset with my experience across project management, operations, and sales to contribute meaningfully to dynamic teams. 

🤝 Let's connect and explore how I may be able to optimize workflows, tackle complex challenges, and deliver impactful solutions for you and your organization.
